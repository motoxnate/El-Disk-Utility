# El-Disk-Utility
A simple new disk utility application for Mac OS 10.11 El Capitan users who are annoyed about the inability to batch process with the new update.

I have not yet added the ability to select multiple drives at once, but you can just go through the application a few times if you need to do something like batch secure-erase some drives. I would prefer to keep this as simple as possible.

Thanks for your support!

11/17/15 - UPDATE Version 1.2
-Fixed bug where the Startup Drive could not be used.
-Added warning that modifying the boot volume can damage user data.
